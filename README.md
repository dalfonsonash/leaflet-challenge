# leaflet-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to educate the public and other government organization on issues affecting our planet.  The USGS may be able to secure more funding should this project prove successful.

The project consists of two parts:

-Part 1: Create Earthquake Visualization
-Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data

Part 1 is contained within the Leaflet-Part-1 directory.  The directory contains the index.html file, and a 'static' folder where the logic.js and style.css is located.

Part 2 is contained within the Leaflet-Part-2 directory.  The directory also contains it's own index.html file, and a 'static' folder where the logic.js and style.css is located.
